# Chess-rs

**WIP**

An implementation of the game of chess written in Rust.

For now, it is a CLI program that shows the board state in ASCII, and the player inputs their moves in [standard chess notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess))


## Goals

- actual graphics
- a good user interface, like [Lichess](https://lichess.org/)
